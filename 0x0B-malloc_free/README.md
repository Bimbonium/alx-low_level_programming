Repo to warehouse my journey into Malloc and Free
Functions like this make me see why C as a language might have gone

Malloc allows dynamic memory allocation, and the memory block alloted persists past the block of code that calls for it, might be problematic in low ram systems
That's where free comes in, I reckon
